Certainly! Let's create a basic example exercise that will help you understand the basic deployments in Kubernetes using Docker and Minikube. In this example, we'll deploy a simple web application as a containerized service.

Objective: Deploy a web application using Kubernetes on a Minikube cluster.

Prerequisites:

    Docker installed on your local machine.
    Minikube installed and running on your local machine.
    kubectl installed on your local machine.

Steps:

## Step 1: Create a Docker Image

    Create a simple web application code. For this example, let's use a basic "Hello, Kubernetes!" web app. You can create a file named index.html with the content:

    html
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, Kubernetes!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
### Create a Dockerfile in the same directory with the following content:

Dockerfile
```
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html
```
### Set the Docker Environment

Before you build the Docker image, you need to make sure that your Docker CLI is configured to use the Docker daemon running inside the Minikube VM. You can do this by running the following command:

bash
```
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```
This command sets the necessary environment variables to point Docker commands to the Minikube Docker daemon.


### Build the Docker image:

bash
```
docker build -t my-web-app:1.0 .
```
Verify that the image has been built:

bash
```
    docker images
```
## Step 2: Start Minikube Cluster

    Start your Minikube cluster using the "none" driver:

    bash
```
    minikube start --driver=none
```
    This will create a local Kubernetes cluster with Minikube running without Docker.

## Step 3: Create a Kubernetes Deployment

    Create a Kubernetes Deployment YAML file named webapp-deployment.yaml:

    yaml
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: webapp-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: webapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: webapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: webapp-container
        image: my-web-app:1.0
```
This YAML file defines a Deployment with three replicas, each running the my-web-app:1.0 Docker image.

### Apply the deployment to your Minikube cluster:

bash
```
kubectl apply -f webapp-deployment.yaml
```
Verify that the deployment is running:

bash
```
    kubectl get pods
```
## Step 4: Expose the Web Application

    Create a Kubernetes Service YAML file named webapp-service.yaml:

    yaml
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: webapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: webapp
  ports:
    - protocol: "TCP"
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: NodePort
```
This YAML file defines a NodePort Service that exposes the web application on a specific port.

### Apply the service to your Minikube cluster:

bash
```
    kubectl apply -f webapp-service.yaml
```
## Step 5: Access the Web Application

    Get the NodePort assigned to the webapp-service:

    bash
```
kubectl get svc webapp-service
```
Note down the NodePort number.

Open a web browser and access the web application by entering the Minikube IP and NodePort in the format: http://MINIKUBE_IP:NODE_PORT.

### You can find the Minikube IP by running:

bash
```
    minikube ip
```
    For example, if your Minikube IP is 192.168.49.2 and the NodePort is 32000, you would access the application at http://192.168.49.2:32000.

## Step 6: Clean Up

To clean up, you can delete the deployment and service:

bash
```
kubectl delete deployment webapp-deployment
kubectl delete service webapp-service
```
This exercise introduces you to the basics of deploying a web application using Kubernetes on Minikube. You can further explore Kubernetes concepts, such as scaling and updates, to deepen your understanding.
