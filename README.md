 Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform used to manage and deploy containerized applications. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you learn Kubernetes from scratch:

Step 1: Understanding the Basics

    Containerization Concepts: Before diving into Kubernetes, make sure you have a good understanding of containerization. Learn about Docker, as it's a popular containerization tool that works seamlessly with Kubernetes.

    Basic Linux Skills: Since you're using Ubuntu, familiarize yourself with basic Linux command-line operations. This knowledge will be crucial when interacting with Kubernetes.

Step 2: Set Up Your Learning Environment

    Install Docker: You'll need Docker to create and manage containers. Install Docker on your Ubuntu machine and practice creating and running containers.

    Install Minikube: Minikube is a tool that lets you run a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally for development and learning purposes. Install Minikube to get a hands-on experience with Kubernetes without dealing with cloud services initially.

Step 3: Core Kubernetes Concepts

    Pods: Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. They can contain one or more containers. Learn how to create pods and interact with them.

    Deployments: Deployments manage the lifecycle of pods. They provide features like scaling, rolling updates, and rollbacks. Understand how to create and manage deployments.

    Services: Services provide networking and load balancing for your pods. Learn about different types of services and how to expose your applications.

    ReplicaSets: While deployments manage pods, they use ReplicaSets under the hood. Understanding ReplicaSets will give you insights into how scaling and rolling updates work.

Step 4: Advanced Concepts

    Namespaces: Namespaces help you logically isolate resources within a cluster. Learn how to create and manage namespaces.

    ConfigMaps and Secrets: These are used to manage configuration and sensitive data separately from your application code.

    Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims: Understand how Kubernetes manages storage for your applications that require persistence.

    Ingress: Ingress controllers allow you to route external traffic to your services. Learn how to set up and manage Ingress resources.

Step 5: Kubernetes Ecosystem Tools

    kubectl: The command-line tool used to interact with Kubernetes clusters. Learn its commands and options.

    Helm: Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. It helps you define, install, and manage Kubernetes applications.

    Kubernetes Dashboard: Install the Kubernetes Dashboard to get a graphical interface for managing your cluster.

Step 6: Real-world Scenarios

    Create Your Own Application: Deploy a simple application with multiple services, replicas, and persistent storage. This will help you apply what you've learned in a practical context.

    Practice Scaling and Updates: Experiment with scaling your application up and down, and perform rolling updates to see how Kubernetes handles these scenarios.

    Monitoring and Logging: Explore tools like Prometheus for monitoring and tools like Fluentd or Loki for logging in a Kubernetes environment.

Step 7: Further Learning

    Online Courses and Tutorials: There are many online resources and courses that provide in-depth knowledge of Kubernetes. Platforms like Kubernetes official website, Udemy, Coursera, and edX offer great courses.

    Read Documentation: The Kubernetes official documentation is an invaluable resource. It's comprehensive and regularly updated.

    Join the Community: Engage with the Kubernetes community through forums, blogs, and social media. Learning from others' experiences can be very beneficial.

Remember that Kubernetes is a complex system, and it's okay to take your time to fully grasp its concepts. Practice and hands-on experience are key to becoming proficient. Good luck on your Kubernetes learning journey!


control plane : responsible for kubernets function

KUbernets worker nodes: nodes can be vitural or phy
managed by contorl plane


kubelet: gets pod specifications from the kubernets api. ensures that pods are running healthy, 

controller: gets the desired state 

kuberneatees proxy: has network rules , network proxy

kubernets objects: persistent entities  eg: pods,namespaces, deployment, volumes. we use kubernaties api towrok with them(kubectl)
namespaces and name: name spaces are used for virtualization of physical cluster to segregate cluster by team, proj etc.

Kubernets objects:
pod: represents proccess running in clustter, its a simplest unit in kerbernets
we can replecate pod services to scalee the application horizontaly

replica set: set of identical pods 
deployments: provides updates for pods and replica sets

Kubectl CLI:
ex: kubectl run nginx --image ngnix

running with yaml file:
ex: kubectl create -f nginx.yaml

Summary & Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know: 

    Container orchestration automates the container lifecycle resulting in faster deployments, reduced errors, higher availability, and more robust security. 

    Kubernetes Is a highly portable, horizontally scalable, open-source container orchestration system with automated deployment and simplified management capabilities.  

    Kubernetes architecture consists of a control plane and one or more worker planes. 

    A control plane includes controllers, an API server, a scheduler, and an etcd. 

    A worker plane includes nodes, a kubelet, container runtime, and kube-proxy. 

    Kubernetes objects include Namespaces, Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments, and Services. 

    Namespaces help in isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. 

    Pods represent a process or an instance of an app running in the cluster. 

    ReplicaSets create and manage horizontally scaled running Pods. 

    Deployments provide updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. 

    A service in Kubernetes is a REST object that provides policies for accessing the pods and cluster. 

    Kubernetes capabilities include automated rollouts and rollbacks, storage orchestration, horizontal scaling, automated bin packing, secret and configuration management, Ipv4/Ipv6 dual-stack support, batch execution, self-healing, service discovery, load balancing, and extensible design. 

    Services in Kubernetes are REST objects that provide policies for accessing the pods and cluster. ClusterIP provides Inter-service communication within the cluster; a NodePort Service creates and routes the incoming requests automatically to the ClusterIP Service; the External Load Balancer, or ELB, creates NodePort and ClusterIP Services automatically and External Name service represents external storage as well as enables Pods from different namespaces to talk to each other.

    Ingress is an API object that provides routing rules to manage external users' access to multiple services in a Kubernetes cluster; whereas using a DaemonSet ensures that there is at least one copy of the pod on all nodes; a StatefulSet manages stateful applications, manages Pod deployment and scaling, maintains a sticky identity for each Pod request and provides persistent storage volumes for your workloads and lastly a Job creates pods and tracks the Pod completion process; Jobs are retried until completed.
