 Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform used to manage and deploy containerized applications. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you learn Kubernetes from scratch:

Step 1: Understanding the Basics

    Containerization Concepts: Before diving into Kubernetes, make sure you have a good understanding of containerization. Learn about Docker, as it's a popular containerization tool that works seamlessly with Kubernetes.

    Basic Linux Skills: Since you're using Ubuntu, familiarize yourself with basic Linux command-line operations. This knowledge will be crucial when interacting with Kubernetes.

Step 2: Set Up Your Learning Environment

    Install Docker: You'll need Docker to create and manage containers. Install Docker on your Ubuntu machine and practice creating and running containers.

    Install Minikube: Minikube is a tool that lets you run a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally for development and learning purposes. Install Minikube to get a hands-on experience with Kubernetes without dealing with cloud services initially.

Step 3: Core Kubernetes Concepts

    Pods: Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. They can contain one or more containers. Learn how to create pods and interact with them.

    Deployments: Deployments manage the lifecycle of pods. They provide features like scaling, rolling updates, and rollbacks. Understand how to create and manage deployments.

    Services: Services provide networking and load balancing for your pods. Learn about different types of services and how to expose your applications.

    ReplicaSets: While deployments manage pods, they use ReplicaSets under the hood. Understanding ReplicaSets will give you insights into how scaling and rolling updates work.

Step 4: Advanced Concepts

    Namespaces: Namespaces help you logically isolate resources within a cluster. Learn how to create and manage namespaces.

    ConfigMaps and Secrets: These are used to manage configuration and sensitive data separately from your application code.

    Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims: Understand how Kubernetes manages storage for your applications that require persistence.

    Ingress: Ingress controllers allow you to route external traffic to your services. Learn how to set up and manage Ingress resources.

Step 5: Kubernetes Ecosystem Tools

    kubectl: The command-line tool used to interact with Kubernetes clusters. Learn its commands and options.

    Helm: Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. It helps you define, install, and manage Kubernetes applications.

    Kubernetes Dashboard: Install the Kubernetes Dashboard to get a graphical interface for managing your cluster.

Step 6: Real-world Scenarios

    Create Your Own Application: Deploy a simple application with multiple services, replicas, and persistent storage. This will help you apply what you've learned in a practical context.

    Practice Scaling and Updates: Experiment with scaling your application up and down, and perform rolling updates to see how Kubernetes handles these scenarios.

    Monitoring and Logging: Explore tools like Prometheus for monitoring and tools like Fluentd or Loki for logging in a Kubernetes environment.

Step 7: Further Learning

    Online Courses and Tutorials: There are many online resources and courses that provide in-depth knowledge of Kubernetes. Platforms like Kubernetes official website, Udemy, Coursera, and edX offer great courses.

    Read Documentation: The Kubernetes official documentation is an invaluable resource. It's comprehensive and regularly updated.

    Join the Community: Engage with the Kubernetes community through forums, blogs, and social media. Learning from others' experiences can be very beneficial.

Remember that Kubernetes is a complex system, and it's okay to take your time to fully grasp its concepts. Practice and hands-on experience are key to becoming proficient. Good luck on your Kubernetes learning journey!


control plane : responsible for kubernets function

KUbernets worker nodes: nodes can be vitural or phy
managed by contorl plane


kubelet: gets pod specifications from the kubernets api. ensures that pods are running healthy, 

controller: gets the desired state 

kuberneatees proxy: has network rules , network proxy

kubernets objects: persistent entities  eg: pods,namespaces, deployment, volumes. we use kubernaties api towrok with them(kubectl)
namespaces and name: name spaces are used for virtualization of physical cluster to segregate cluster by team, proj etc.

Kubernets objects:
pod: represents proccess running in clustter, its a simplest unit in kerbernets
we can replecate pod services to scalee the application horizontaly

replica set: set of identical pods 
deployments: provides updates for pods and replica sets

Kubectl CLI:
ex: kubectl run nginx --image ngnix

running with yaml file:
ex: kubectl create -f nginx.yaml
